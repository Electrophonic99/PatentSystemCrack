# PatentSystemCrack

**A first-principles framework for identifying untapped patentable space. Initial Outline built in less than one hour. No AI. Pure cognition.**

## Abstract

This repository contains a cognitive blueprint for decoding the patent system using logic, mathematics, and first-principles reasoning. Developed independently and without AI assistance, the framework reveals how to identify remaining viable patents by analyzing structural gaps in classification and novelty logic.

## Cognitive Credentials

- GATE-qualified
- High-accuracy performance in untimed logic-based environments
- No AI assistance used in development
- Completed in ~1 hour using pure cognition

## Signal Statement

This work was created without external tools, automation, or collaboration. It reflects architect-level cognition and systems thinking. The full white paper is included below.
